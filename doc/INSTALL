 OpenBabel is not included anymore since it works now with the official 2.3.2 release. 

1.) Install postgresql > 8.x from source and put pgchem_tigress/ under the contrib/ directory. It likely will also work with a prepackaged PostgreSQL but then you need the matching development headers.

IF YOU COMPILE YOURSELF: 

On Windows:
I will not support Windows anymore. The build process with MinGW is horrible and Linux is the superior platform for PostgreSQL anyway.  

On Linux:
OpenBabel can be compiled ans installed out of the box as described here: http://openbabel.org/docs/dev/Installation/install.html 

After successful compiliation of OpenBabel you _must_ rename the file openbabel-x.y.z/include/openbabel/locale.h to _locale.h otherwise the compiler will barf when compiling pgchem!

2.) On Linux copy or link libbarsoi.so, libpgchem.so into the postgresql lib/ directory.
The PostgreSQL server process must be able to see OpenBabel when running! So LD_LIBRARY_PATH on Linux must point to the OpenBabel lib/ director!
3.) create a database. You can name it as you like. All follwing steps must be executed on that database you've just created
4.) CREATE EXTENSION pgchem_tigress; or execute pgchem_tigress--unpackaged--x.x.sql manually.
